          <p>I have no idea what I'm doing here, but since I most certainly <em>am</em> here, I'll make the most of it.</p>
          <p>I'm from a magical world called Mirelia, which is <strong>so</strong> unlike this one... But now, there are dangers
            lurking <em>everywhere</em>. Once I get back, I need to make sure Mirelia is kept safe from those dangers. I am but one
            woman and I cannot protect Mirelia on my own. I am going to need as much help as I can get.</p>
            <p> Can I count on you?</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I've been toying with the idea of advancing my programming skills from basic <em>Python</em> generators to something more
            complex for quite some time, but I was warried about how time-consuming learning to code would be.</p>
          <p>Then I saw this ad for a coding app called <strong><a href="https://getmimo.com">Mimo</a></strong> several times and eventually I decided to try it. Now, not two weeks
            later, I'm working on this blog and I'm even trying to make a browser-based game.</p>
